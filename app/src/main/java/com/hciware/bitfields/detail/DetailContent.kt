// I don't understand my design.. why does each section have its own row as well as column..
// So change that so that all the fields are in a single row... or maybe alternate.. try single row first
// If the field names are large they will overlap.. single bit fields will be interesting..
// Maybe have the value editors in a single row but the names alternate top or bottom?
// How do we edit the field length and label?? not sure I've thought that far
// Maybe have an edit bitfield button and then we drag the field and the labels become edited able in the same layout??
